<h3>About Mr. Buran</h3>
<p>Mr. Buran used to be an excellent Biology teacher. This was until his unfortunate incident with prior freshman Timmy Marnell. 
Timmy was a vibrant, athletic, and academic student. His opportunity and promise was unlimited. Unfortunately, during the 2020-21 academic year, 
Timmy was brutally beaten in a game of ping-pong against Mr. Buran. This lost devestated Timmy and his family. So much so, he has still been 
been unable to recooperate to this day. Timmy remains in active recovery, whilst Mr. Buran continues teaching his freshman Honors Biology class. 
My fellow students and I will not stand for Mr. Buran's shenanigans. Together, we must make a stand against his tyranny.

<h4>Why He's My Hero</h4>
<p>Mr. Buran is my hero because he was able to beat sophomore Timmy Marnell during a ping-pong match in his freshman year. Mr. Buran's unforgiving attitude
against Timmy and all of his students inspires me on a day-to-day basis. As a result of Timmy's embarassing loss against Mr. Buran, his final exam resulted in a zero.

<h5>The Time Mr. Buran Survived a Bomb-Threat</h5>
<p>On Feb. 21, Mr. Buran was preparing to build a hot-tub in his backyard by hand. Suddenly, Mr. Buran found an unused mortar round in his yard. 
Mr. Buran, thinking on his feet, picked up the mortar, and threw it with all of his might across the world. This mortar round circled the Earth's atmosphere at speeds unimaginable, 
and eventually, landed on Timmy Marnell's home. Fortunately, Timmy and his loved ones were safe from the blast. However, Timmy would live in sadness for the rest of his life. Meanwhile, 
Mr. Buran enjoyed his newly installed hot-tub.
